this is the privacy policy of the mobile application Sabiqoon.

I will only use your location to let you know how close you are to the grave you are looking for. I will not store your location only because you used my app.

I might use your location in future versions when you raise a suggestion just to have more context as in which grave yard you were in when you raised that suggestion.
